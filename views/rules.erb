<h1>The Rules!</h1>
<body>
  Rock Paper Scissors is a game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously chooses one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are
  <ul>
    <li>rock (a closed fist)</li>
    <li>paper (a flat hand)</li>
    <li>scissors</li>
  </ul>
  A simultaneous, zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes: a draw, or a win for one player and a loss for the other.

  A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"[1]), but will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper"). If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
